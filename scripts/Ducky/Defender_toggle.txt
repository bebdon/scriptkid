REM This script opens Windows Security, navigates to 'Virus & threat protection', and toggles Windows Defender settings using keyboard shortcuts and delays.
REM The '1000' is equal to miliseconds so when you look to delay an action during the script use "DELAY 1000"- means 1 second, 5000-5 seconds. The DELAY command just means do nothing for X amount of time.
